			<h2>About this app</h2>
			<h3>Instructions for using the app</h3>
				<p>The application starts automatically when it is loaded. Each row is selected at 1 second time interval, depicted by the green rectangle.
				To select a specific button on the calculator, user needs to enter specific row where the button is, using  'z' key on the keyboard. Once user is inside the desired row,
						each row keeps being highlighted at 1 second interval, using a blue square. To click on the desired button, user needs to press 'z' key when the button is
				highlighted.</p>
				<h3>Test Description</h3>
				<p>The application has been tested with three versions:
				<li> Navigation using two keys, one for moving to next button, another for selecting the button.[ 'q' for movement', 'm' for selection ] </li>
				<li> Navigation using one key, continuous selection of row after 3 seconds of interval. </li>
				<li> Navigation using one key, continuous selection of row after 1 second of interval. </li>
				</p>
				<p> User was given five equations : "5 * 55 + 26 - 3", 485 / 55 - 3", "5 /45 * 55 + 26 - 3", "6 * 12 + 12 - 6", "5 * 100 /25 + 26 - 3".
				User was tested on three trials for each version: using back of the hand, using knuckles, using toes
-				</p>
			<h3>Test Result</h3>
			<p>User has made errors in all trials and had to start over for completing the test. On average, more errors were made when using back of hand
				and toes, than when using knuckles. When using two keys, user found difficulty , specially with the toe, as the keys were very far apart from each
				other on the keyboard, and thus	took more time to complete compare to the other versions. He made 5 errors in this version. In the other two versions, the user took around 2 minutes
			to complete each equation, and made 3 errors. However, the version with 3 seconds navigation interval caused more time delay for user and made him frustrated of waiting too much. 				
			Overall, the user found the version with one key and 1 second interval to be the optimum.</p>
